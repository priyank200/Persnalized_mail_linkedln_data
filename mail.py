    ## Email 1 - The Agile Monkeys
    
    Hey Francisco,
    
    I noticed that youâ€™re responsible for finance at The Agile Monkeys and wanted to share some ideas I thought of that could help you reduce manual billing efforts and improve cash flow:
    
    - Automate event-driven billing for the full-stack software engineers to reduce manual work and streamline finance processes.
    - Improve cash flow by automating revenue recognition workflows tailored to serverless application development services.
    - Outsource billing for complex usage-based models without engineering resources, ensuring accurate and error-free billing.
    
    If you're interested, I'm from Zenskar, where we've built a cost effective AI solution that can help you implement these ideas.
    
    Best,
    Zenskar
    
    ## Email 2
    
    Hi Name,
    
    Many congratulations as you celebrate 10 years of Genomics England! Itâ€™s great to see how your 100000 Genomes Project has transformed the face of genomic healthcare in the UK :)
    
    That said, any chance you're looking for new ways to transform billing workflows? I thought  of a few tailored strategies that could help you:
    
    - Automate usage-based pricing & billing with unlimited flexibility for Genomicâ€™s patient treatments division
    - Improve cash flows for your NHS patient diagnostics segment with automated payment reminders
    - Improve revenue forecasting with real-time visibility in revenue metrics
    
    If you're interested, we've built a billing tool that can help you implement these strategies. Can we schedule a quick call?
    
    Thanks,\n"""
